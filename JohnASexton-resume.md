_Previous Titles: "Staff DevOps Engineer", "Lead DevOps Engineer, D2C DevOps Architecture" and "Systems Specialist, Development, D2C DevOps Architecture"_
* Led large-scale Digital Transformation effort, migrating 100+ Java services from CI only, to Continuous Deployment design patterns, accelerating deployment cadence from every 2 months during late night change windows, with a large team engaged for many hours, to any business day or hour with only 1 SRE, 1 DEV & 1 Tester as deployment team
* Drove team from entirely on-prem Datacenter operations to partially, then fully embrace cloud native approaches 
* Defined overarching DevOps Architecture of Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, and Continuous Deployment automation practices at Macys Technology in the Order Management, direct to consumer area

* Established inner-sourcing Enterprise code sharing model using GitLab Enterprise on company intranet
* Engineered Continuous Testing model as part of achieving Continuous Delivery paradigm
* Moved team away from branching & merging anti-pattern, away from Subversion (SVN), and was part of a small team that brought GitLab Enterprise into Macys, helping many teams outside of my own migrate from SVN to Git in the process
* Socialized cloud native code definition with Development teams, that was used to drive greenfield development projects away from SOA / SOAP / XML practices toward properly decomposed 12-factor REST microservices
* Migrated team from Test Driven Development TDD paradigm, to Behavior Driven Development BDD paradigm & gave Enterprise Tech Talk from boardroom on the subject following our team's successful implementation as role model
* Encouraged development team to embrace feature toggle practices, and provided multiple key:value stores for both Legacy and GCP Native applications that developers could manage themselves via self-service via Zookeeper & Kubernetes-configmaps
* Converted all freestyle Jenkins jobs to declarative groovy DSL pipeline as code
* Integrated Atlassian FishEye, GitLab Enterprise and Atlassian Jira, while enforcing Jira Story was present in every commit and branch, resulting in every branch or commit reporting back to Jira story to resulting in traceability of assigned work to actual development effort observability across all roles
* implemented and iteratively improved Configuration Management practice using Opscode Chef and Django API translation layer to achieve multi-cloud provisioning while writing against a single internal API framework at VM level
* Automated Enterprise APIs cross-organizationally using: Chef, Docker, Jenkins, vCloud, SoftLayer, JBoss, Maven, Artifactory, IBM Urban Code Deploy, GitLab Enterprise, GitLab Community, FishEye, Crucible, Sonarqube, Checkmarx, Serenity, HP-ALM, Plutora, Dynatrace, Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana and Nagios to achieve quality gating, compliance while eliminating manual processes and delays
* Provided educational leadership via Boardroom Tech Talks, DevOpsATL Meetups hosted on Macys premises, lunch & learns, Skype conferences, video recordings, and information radiators like Jira, Confluence, git book wiki pages, and blog posts to socialize out the emerging practices to the organization at large, as well as present ideas up to senior leadership
* Continuously evaluated/re-evaluated current level of DevOps Maturity against an objective DevOps Maturity Model
* Developed long term adoption road maps, for direct to consumer, core revenue, ordering, line of business
* Quantified results via Value Stream Mapping & Platform metrics
* Created Curated DevOps Content playlists on Skillport LMS portal in conjunction with Learning & Development organization

_Previous Titles: "Senior Systems Architect & Senior Systems Administrator (MTS-III)", "Senior Systems Administrator (MTS-II)"", "Systems Administrator (MTS-I)"_
* Led large-scale Digital Transformation effort, migrating 120+ Java services from CI only, to Continuous Deployment design patterns, accelerating deployment cadence from every 2 months during late night change windows, to multiple times a day during prime business hours
* Reorganized Planning, Development, Testing and Ops silos into smaller cross-functional "Verizon Pods" inspired by "Amazon 2 Pizza Teams" and "Spotify Squads", resulting in right sizing teams to initiatives, increased crossing and embedding, reducing blame, which improved collaboration and affinity, which in turn increased development velocity
* Developed Jenkins continuous integration (CI), continuous delivery and continuous deployment (CD) automations, integrating business processes, SDLC governance, disaster recovery, test automation, enterprise monitoring, and configuration management for WAN scope applications used by Verizon SalesForce SFDC Team, servicing Enterprise Customers
* Implemented Blue | Green methodology using geographically distributed cluster switching, at Netscaler GSLB load balancer level, resulting in zero downtime deployments
* Led first team at Verizon effort to automate Change Management compliance via API calls in CD Jenkins automations
* Virtualized Web services and API interface tests with CA-LISA / CA-DevTest to decouple external team integration partner dependencies in lower lifecycle environments, eliminating issues where partner teams might cause delays in development velocity
* Implemented automated continuous testing in all lifecycles, to meet continuous delivery goals
* Leveraged Sonatype Nexus as repository for build artifacts to ensure code reproducibility
* Configured System instrumentation testing, via Jenkins API calls to CA-APM, to perform deployment readiness checks, that gated automated deployments off health checks, to avoid deploying to an overburdened or unavailable host
* Automated System under test (SuT) performance stress test loads, with HP LoadRunner API calls from Jenkins
* Compared Pivotal Cloud Foundry and RedHat Openshift PaaS offerings in POC, implemented PCF, implemented Openstack Cloud in on-prem data centers, performing 'cf push' deploys to on-prem Openstack VMs, and public cloud Amazon Web Services AWS EC2 in Q4 2015
