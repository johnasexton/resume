  * Converted all freestyle Jenkins jobs to declarative groovy DSL pipeline as code, reducing manual touch & enabling self-provisioning
  * Migrated team from Test Driven Development TDD to Behavior Driven Development BDD paradigm
  * Engineered platforms from fixed property files to dynamic feature toggle practices
  * Provided multiple key:value stores for both Legacy and Cloud Native applications using Zookeeper & Kubernetes-configmaps
  * Integrated Atlassian FishEye and Jira with GitLab Enterprise to establish full traceability and visibility from story to feature branch to commit
  * implemented and iteratively improved Configuration Management practice using Opscode Chef and Django API translation layer to achieve multi-cloud provisioning while writing against a single internal API framework at VM level
* DevOps Thought Leadership efforts:
  * Continuously evaluated/re-evaluated current level of DevOps Maturity against an objective DevOps Maturity Model
  * Developed long term Platform Engineering road maps and quantified results via Value Stream Mapping & Platform metrics
  * Collaborated with Agile Coach to reorganize single function team silos into cross-functional "Macys Delivery Teams"
  * Established inner-sourcing Enterprise code sharing model using GitLab Enterprise on company intranet
  * Co-chaired DevOps Core Council, planning activities for the DevOps community of practice to socialize DevOps best-practices throughout Macys Technology
